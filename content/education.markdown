# Public Education

Cowichan Search and Rescue also undertakes outdoor safety public education, with trained presenters for AdventureSmart, a national program dedicated to encouraging Canadians and visitors to Canada to “Get informed and go outdoors”, and Hug-a-Tree and Survive, a similar program aimed at helping lost children survive in the woods.

By following three easy steps, AdventureSmart believes that outdoor recreationalists will significantly improve their chances of survival should they become hurt or lost.
