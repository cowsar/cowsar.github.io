Tracking is a very old and very useful technique for finding a lost person. It can vastly reduce the number of people and the amount of time it takes to find a lost person, but it is a skill that takes training and practise. SAR tracking certification and training are managed by the [BC Tracking Association](http://www.bctracking.org/), a BCSARA [member group](http://www.bcsara.com/sar-groups/regions/provincial/). Various levels of certification are offered from Tracker 1, 2 and 3 to Sign Cutter.
