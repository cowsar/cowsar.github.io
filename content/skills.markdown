Every member of our group is trained to high degree of proficiency in Ground Search and Rescue techniques. All members take part in a 90-hour Justice Institute training program to acquire the basic skills required of certified SAR volunteers. As our core resource, these are the skills the public and the RCMP (and agencies such as BC Ambulance Service) rely on to assist or find people.
