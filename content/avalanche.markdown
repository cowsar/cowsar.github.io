Similar to ice rescue, most of BC has significant snow during the winter, and any operations on snow on slopes over a certain angle (steepness) involve the possibility of an avalanche. Training is required in BC for all operations in avalanche terrain regardless of the kind of rescue (avalanche or otherwise) being performed because SAR members have to travel through the avalanche hazard even if they are looking for a lost person.

Basic Avalanche rescue training involves terrain analysis, safe travel techniques, and rescue skills with avalanche transceivers, probes and shoves. Advanced training includes managing teams of people for a rescue, and team leadership. Even more advanced training is offered through the Canadian Avalanche Association’s specialized Avalanche Operations courses.
