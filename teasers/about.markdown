# About Cowichan Search & Rescue

<div class="about__content"
     markdown="1">

Cowichan SAR is a registered non-profit society providing volunteer Search and Rescue services to residents of the greater Cowichan Valley.

Our territory spans the width of the Island from the Malahat summit in the south to the Chemainus River in the north. Within this territory, our members provide 24-hour, 365-day coverage for people lost or injured in the wilderness.

Every member of our group is trained to high degree of proficiency in Ground Search and Rescue techniques. All members take part in a 90-hour Justice Institute training program to acquire the basic skills required of certified SAR volunteers. As our core resource, these are the skills the public and the RCMP (and agencies such as BC Ambulance Service) rely on to assist or find people.
